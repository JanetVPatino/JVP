# Code Refractor Homework_Assignment1

Objective: Clean up HTML and CSS code to enhance web accesibilty and improve overall user experience on a given website.

# Issues with the website & changes implemented: 

	1. The webiste name Horiseon has two different color schemes and was changed to all one color.
  
	2. The search engine optimization link did not work when clicked.
  
	3. The first image needed to be resized to be smaller. It took up too much space on the website.
  
	4. The positioning of the headers:search engine, online reputation management, 
  and social media marketing needed to be adjusted so it did not move around when you zoom in.
  
	5. The online reputation management image needed to be moved to the left to align with the other images.
  
	6. The text was hard to read. This was fixed by changing to a light background and a darker text.
  
	7. The headers needed to be a different color than the paragraph texts to make them stand out more.
  
	8. All the images were missing an alt attribute and were each given one to describe the image to the user in case 
  there was an issue in viewing the image. 
  
	9. The title element was renamed to be more concise and descriptive of the website.
  
  10. The code was modified and comments were inserted to explain in further detail the changes made, if any. 
  
  # Conclusion:
  This assignment helped me gain a better understanding on how HTML and CSS work 
  together to improve web accesibilty and also taught me that there are more efficent ways
  to organize code, you just have to find what works for you!
